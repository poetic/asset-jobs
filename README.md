# Asset Jobs

Application for displaying and linking to open positions using the greenhouse API

## Deployment

Application is currently deployed via JSDelivr and including the dependecty libraries via script tabs on the page.

Currently the deployment is set to follow the main branch

## Setup

Using VSCode live server serve the `asset-jobs-webflow.html` file and changes made to `greenhouse-careers.js` will automatically update

## Legacy Codebase

This is a legacy codebase and any significant changes should warrant a refactor/update of current implementation using functional components and a current version of react.

Ideally this application would have a build process and CICD pipeline attached so that this can be a traditional react application with one tag required to embed.
